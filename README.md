# Canvas-Dot
A small little program mostly cobbled together as Canvas practice for my final project at Makers Academy, however I liked it so much that I wanted to keep it somewhere. Clone it into a new folder on your machine and play around with the code, I will detail what parts of the code to change to achieve different results in the Readme bellow. If you create something cool feel free to share it with me.

# Quick Start
Clone the repository to a new folder on your machine. Then type open test.html into the command line whist inside the new folder, this will open your default browser with a new tab displaying the canvas.

## Ball Mode
To use Ball mode, ensure that the code on line 19 of code.js is uncommented (default). This will give you a dot that changes colour when it hits the edges of the canvas.

## Art Mode
To use Art Mode, Comment out line 19 in the code.js file. This will stop the canvas from refreshing and leave the trail from the ball behind, as the ball still randomly changes colour you can get really cool looking Geometric art such as:

As the colours are random each piece of art is unique.

## Customization

1. Change the values of dx and dy on lines 6 and 7 of code.js to change the angle that the ball bounces off the walls at. Can lead to some crazy effects.
2. Change the value of the ball radius on code.js line 3 to change the size of the ball
3. Change the size of the canvas itself on test.html line 13. Will lead to some interesting patterns.

I hope that you guys have some fun with this little bit of code. Enjoy :)
